# FireplacesProject
Working with DC_properties data I have found that one property has 293920 fireplaces(which looks incorrect)
After binnig the data I have found:

|century|number of property|price(mean)|
|---|---|---|
|19|126204|1.03....|
|20|17646| 5.83...|
 |18|               14763  |         7.18....|
 |17 |                 73    |       1.25...|
 
 I conclude that mean price of 73 buildings of 17 century is higher that mean price of 126204 buildings of 19 century probably because of historical value of buildings of 17 century. 
 Also I have noticed that the number of fireplaces in rooms depends on the century of building. The data shows the tendency of reducing the number of fireplaces in houses in the period from 17 century to 20 century that is logical after invention of electricity.
